### About Me

My name is Isaac, and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student studying at [Luther College](https://www.luther.edu).
This is my non-school Github page, where I keep my projects unrelated to course activities or academic projects.

I am interested in working on projects which are interactive, communicate information in novel ways, and provide unique challenges
to me as a programmer. I also hope to eventually contribute to free and open-source projects which I rely on each day to complete
my tasks.

My other interests include language learning (both programming and natural languages), history, mapping, and science - both fact and
fiction.

### Where to find me

I don't generally keep much of a social media presence, but I can be found on:
 - [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-list/)
 - Github: both my [Personal](https://github.com/Isaac-Newt/) and [Academic](https://github.com/isaac-list/) accounts

However, the best way to contact me is by email at one of the following addresses:
 - [Personal Contact](mailto:isaac.newt.list@icloud.com)
 - [School Contact](mailto:listis01@luther.edu)
